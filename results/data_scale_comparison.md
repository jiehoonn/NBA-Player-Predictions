---

## Key Insights

### 1. More Data = Better Performance ‚úÖ

All three targets showed improvement with the extended dataset:
- PTS: -5.5% error reduction
- REB: -2.3% error reduction
- AST: -6.5% error reduction (best)

### 2. AST Benefits Most from Scale

Assists prediction improved the most (-6.5%), likely because:
- Playmaking is highly context-dependent
- More opponent team styles captured (5 seasons vs 3)
- Wider range of player roles (200 vs 120 players)

### 3. Goal Achievement Status

| Goal | 3 Seasons | 5 Seasons | Status |
|------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| PTS < 3.6 | ‚ùå 5.774 | ‚ùå 5.454 | Progress but not achieved |
| REB < 2.2 | ‚úÖ 2.185 | ‚úÖ 2.134 | Achieved (improved further) |
| AST < 2.0 | ‚úÖ 1.762 | ‚úÖ 1.647 | Achieved (improved further) |

**Overall: 2/3 goals achieved** (same as before, but with better margins)

### 4. Overfitting Check ‚úÖ

Train-to-test MAE increase remains low:
- PTS: 1.3% increase (5.384 ‚Üí 5.454)
- REB: 1.7% increase (2.098 ‚Üí 2.134)
- AST: 3.8% increase (1.587 ‚Üí 1.647)

All under 5% threshold = **excellent generalization**

## Why More Data Helps

### Player Diversity (120 ‚Üí 200 players)

**More playing styles captured:**
- Pure shooters, playmakers, rebounders, two-way players
- Bench players vs starters
- Young players vs veterans

**Impact:** Model learns from wider range of performance patterns

### Temporal Coverage (3 ‚Üí 5 seasons)

**More contexts captured:**
- COVID-shortened season (2020-21)
- Return to normalcy (2021-22)
- Recent seasons (2022-25)

**Impact:** Better handles regime changes and evolving playstyles

### Training Data (15.8K ‚Üí 44.6K games)

**Statistical robustness:**
- 182% more training samples
- Better feature correlation estimates
- More reliable rolling average patterns

**Impact:** Reduced overfitting, better generalization

## Recommendations

### For Further Improvement (PTS still at 5.45 vs 3.6 goal)

1. **Add shot location data**
   - 3-point attempts vs mid-range vs paint
   - Shot difficulty metrics

2. **Include defensive matchup info**
   - Opponent's defensive scheme
   - Individual defender quality

3. **Add player fatigue indicators**
   - Minutes per game trend
   - Back-to-back game performance decay

4. **Try ensemble methods**
   - Combine Lasso + XGBoost predictions
   - Weighted by recent performance

5. **Feature engineering**
   - Interaction terms (home √ó opponent_defense)
   - Season-specific trends

### For Production Deployment

**Use the 5-season, 200-player configuration:**
- ‚úÖ Best performance across all targets
- ‚úÖ 2/3 goals achieved with better margins
- ‚úÖ No overfitting issues
- ‚úÖ Robust to data collection failures (enhanced pipeline)

## Technical Notes

### Data Collection Enhancements

Successfully implemented:
- ‚úÖ Retry logic with exponential backoff (5 retries, 2-48s delays)
- ‚úÖ Checkpointing after each season
- ‚úÖ Empty list handling for failed API calls
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation if team stats unavailable
- ‚úÖ Mixed date format parsing
- ‚úÖ Backup save mechanism

**Result:** 100% success rate collecting 57,812 games

## Conclusion

**Expanding the dataset from 3 to 5 seasons and 120 to 200 players yields significant performance gains:**

1. ‚úÖ **All targets improved** (PTS -5.5%, REB -2.3%, AST -6.5%)
2. ‚úÖ **2/3 goals achieved** (REB and AST under target)
3. ‚úÖ **No overfitting** (train-test gap < 5%)
4. ‚úÖ **Robust data pipeline** (handles failures gracefully)

**The investment in more data collection was worthwhile and should be the production configuration.**

Next steps: Focus on feature engineering and ensemble methods to push PTS prediction toward the 3.6 goal.
