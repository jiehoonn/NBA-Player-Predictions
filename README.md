### üìà Performance Results (Test Set)

| Target  | Model   | Test MAE  | Baseline MAE | Improvement | Goal | Status          |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ---- | --------------- |
| **PTS** | Lasso   | **5.448** | 5.655        | **+3.7%**   | 3.6  | üöß In Progress  |
| **REB** | XGBoost | **2.134** | 2.186        | **+2.4%**   | 2.2  | ‚úÖ **Achieved** |
| **AST** | XGBoost | **1.642** | 1.679        | **+2.2%**   | 2.0  | ‚úÖ **Achieved** |

**Baseline:** 5-game rolling average (simple persistence model)

**Key Insight:** Our models improve over baseline on all three targets, with REB and AST meeting our ambitious goals. PTS prediction is more challenging due to higher variance in scoring patterns.

### üî¨ Research Journey: From Exploration to Production

Our development followed a rigorous **research-to-production** workflow documented in 9 Jupyter notebooks:

#### Phase 1: Initial Exploration (Notebooks 01-05)

- **Notebook 01**: Data collection setup with NBA API
- **Notebook 02**: Exploratory data analysis - distributions, correlations, temporal patterns
- **Notebook 03**: Baseline models (5-game rolling average: MAE ~6.3 for PTS)
- **Notebook 04**: Preliminary ML models (Random Forest, basic features)
- **Notebook 05**: Feature importance analysis and feature engineering improvements

#### Phase 2: Scaling Up (Notebook 06)

- **Key Finding**: Initial attempt with 1 season, 44 players ‚Üí **0-1% improvement over baseline**
- **Lesson Learned**: Need more data and better features

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Data Collection (Notebook 07)

- **Scale Jump**: 1 season to **5 seasons** (2020-25), 44 players to **200 players**
- **Critical Bug Discovery**: Merging on `Game_ID` alone caused **Cartesian product duplication** (171K rows instead of 24K)
- **Fix**: Merge on `['PLAYER_ID', 'Game_ID']` - prevented data contamination
- **New Features**: Added opponent stats, rest days, home/away context
- **Impact**: Baseline improved ~7% due to scale (PTS: -5.5%, REB: -2.3%, AST: -6.5%), further improvements with more data
  - _See detailed methodology in_ `results/data_scale_comparison.md`

#### Phase 4: Feature Engineering (Notebook 08)

- **Implemented Leakage-Safe Features**:
  - Rolling averages (3/5 games) for stats: PTS, REB, AST, MIN
  - Usage features: FGA, FTA, FG3A, FG_PCT
  - Contextual features: IS_HOME, REST_DAYS, opponent ratings, pace
- **Total: 23 baseline features** (9 original + 8 usage + 6 contextual)
  - _Note: Phase 1 advanced features (15 additional) are documented separately_
- **Critical Pattern**: `df['PTS'].shift(1).rolling(3).mean()` - shift(1) prevents current game leakage
- **Validation**: Unit tests verify leakage prevention with known values

#### Phase 5: Model Comparison (Notebook 09) ‚≠ê **BEST MODEL SELECTION**

- **Systematic Comparison**: 8 models √ó 2 feature sets = 16 experiments
- **Models Tested**: Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Net
- **Key Findings**:
  - **PTS**: Lasso (alpha=0.1) performs best - linear relationship with shooting stats
  - **REB/AST**: XGBoost (n=100, depth=3, lr=0.05) wins - captures non-linear patterns
  - **Neural nets overfit** with 23 features - simpler models generalize better
  - **Contextual features** add 1-3% improvement over rolling averages alone

#### Phase 6: Production Pipeline (src/)

- **Translated research to production code**:
  - `src/data/collect_data.py` - Data collection with rate limiting and caching
  - `src/features/build_features.py` - Leakage-safe feature engineering
  - `src/models/train_models.py` - Best model selection from Notebook 09
  - `src/models/evaluate_models.py` - Comprehensive evaluation
  - `src/visualization/make_plots.py` - 39 publication-quality plots
- **Added comprehensive testing** (16 unit + 8 integration tests)
- **CI/CD pipeline** with automated testing and code quality checks
- **JSON schema validation** for model metrics and experimental results

### üß™ Testing Strategy: Validate Functionality, Not Just Existence

Our testing philosophy prioritizes **mathematical correctness** over code coverage metrics.

#### What We Test (16 Unit Tests + 8 Integration Tests)

**Feature Engineering Tests (7 tests):**

```python
def test_rolling_features_calculation():
    """Test with known values: avg([10, 20]) = 15"""
    # Creates data: PTS = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    # Verifies game 3: avg(10, 20) = 15.0 ‚úì
```

```python
def test_leakage_prevention():
    """Ensure future games don't leak into past predictions"""
    # Creates outlier: PTS = [100, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    # Verifies game 1 uses only [100], not [100, 10, 10]
```

**Model Training Tests (9 tests):**

```python
def test_model_selection_pts():
    """Verify PTS uses Lasso with hyperparameters from Notebook 09"""
    model, name = get_best_model("PTS")
    assert name == "Lasso"
    assert model.alpha == 0.1  # From systematic comparison
```

**Integration Tests (8 tests):**

- Pipeline component compatibility
- Feature engineering output structure
- Config and Makefile validation

**CI/CD:** All 24 tests run automatically on every push (Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12)

---

### üîë Critical Implementation Details

#### 1. Leakage Prevention Pattern

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Leakage-safe
player_df['pts_last_3'] = player_df['PTS'].shift(1).rolling(3, min_periods=1).mean()

# ‚ùå WRONG - Includes current game!
player_df['pts_last_3'] = player_df['PTS'].rolling(3).mean()
```

**Validated by**: `test_leakage_prevention` with known outlier data

#### 2. Data Duplication Bug (Fixed in Notebook 07)

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Creates 171,639 duplicate rows
df.merge(opponent_stats, on='Game_ID', how='left')

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Proper join on both keys
df.merge(opponent_stats, on=['PLAYER_ID', 'Game_ID'], how='left')
```

#### 3. Time-Based Splits (No Shuffling!)

```python
# Train: 44,600 games (78.5%) - before 2024-07-31
# Val:    5,100 games (9.0%)  - 2024-08-01 to 2024-12-31
# Test:   7,112 games (12.5%) - after 2024-12-31
```

**Never shuffle** - maintains temporal ordering to prevent leakage.

#### 4. JSON Schema Validation

All model metrics and experimental results are validated against strict JSON schemas:

**schemas/model_metrics_schema.json**: Validates model training outputs

- Enforces semantic versioning (v<major>.<minor>.<patch>$)
- Numeric bounds on improvement percentages (-100 to 100,000)
- Required fields for reproducibility (git_commit, random_seed, training_date, model_artifact)
- Type validation: size_mb as number (not string), proper SHA256 checksum format

**schemas/experiment_results_schema.json**: Validates data scale experiments

- Enforces num_players in all experimental results (required field)
- Validates season format patterns (YYYY-YY)
- Ensures complete metadata tracking for reproducibility

**Impact**: Prevents invalid data from entering the pipeline, catches errors at validation time rather than runtime.

**Validation**: All existing results validated against schemas post-implementation. Tests include syntax checks + structure validation.

### üìù Next Steps for PTS Improvement

Our current PTS model (MAE 5.77) is **60% of the way to our goal** (3.6). To bridge the gap:

**Short-term improvements:**

1. **Shot location data**: Add mid-range %, 3PT %, paint % from NBA API
2. **Matchup quality**: Include defender rating/position data
3. **Player trends**: Add injury/load management indicators
4. **Ensemble methods**: Combine Lasso + XGBoost predictions

**Medium-term improvements:** 5. **Deeper tree models**: Increase XGBoost max_depth (currently 3) 6. **Feature interactions**: Add polynomial features for shooting stats 7. **Player embeddings**: Neural network player embeddings for style 8. **Advanced opponent stats**: Opponent PTS allowed by position

**Expected impact**: Based on literature and our experiments, we estimate these improvements could reduce MAE by **1.5-2.5 points**, getting us to the 3.6 goal.

---

### üéì Key Learnings

1. **Scale matters**: 5 seasons vs 1 season ‚Üí **significant baseline improvement**, more data = better generalization
2. **Leakage prevention is critical**: `.shift(1)` before `.rolling()` prevents contamination
3. **Data quality > Data quantity**: Fixing the merge bug was more impactful than adding features
4. **Simpler models often win**: With 38 features, Lasso/XGBoost outperform neural nets
5. **Test what matters**: Validate mathematical correctness, not just code structure
6. **Advanced features add value**: 15 Phase 1 features (efficiency, trends, consistency) provide incremental gains
7. **Tree models excel at non-linear**: REB/AST have complex patterns ‚Üí XGBoost wins

## Original Project Proposal (For Reference)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand original proposal and detailed implementation plan</summary>

### 1) Project Description

We aim to build an automated, end-to-end system that:

- Collects and snapshots NBA player game logs and context (team ratings, schedules, rest, travel distance).
- Engineers leakage-safe features using only information available **before** each game.
- Trains per-target regression models (PTS, REB, AST) with strict time-based validation.
- Benchmarks performance against na√Øve rolling-average baselines and reports results with confidence intervals.
- Provides reproducible code and interpretable insights.

### Minimal viable scope

The first milestone focuses on:

- Collecting data
- Implementing cleaning rules
- Generating a set of sensible features (rolling averages and a small number of context variables)
- Training baseline models and **one main predictive model per target**
- Evaluating on a time-forward split

**Complex features** (travel distance, opponent allowances by position, SHAP explanations, interactive dashboard) are clearly delineated as **optional extensions** to pursue if time allows.

### Scope details

- **Data window:** Regular season games from 2022-23, 2023-24, and 2024-25, frozen through **2025-04-15 23:59:59 UTC** (end of the 2024-25 regular season).
- **Targets:** Per-player per-game points (PTS), rebounds (REB), and assists (AST).
- **Reproducibility:** All steps are deterministic with pinned software versions and fixed random seeds. Data snapshots are saved with immutable file names containing the freeze date.

---

### 2) Clear Goals and Success Criteria

#### Primary goal

Predict per-player per-game PTS, REB, and AST using contextual and historical features.

#### Quantitative success criteria

On a held-out, time-forward test set (see **Test Plan**):

- Improve mean absolute error (MAE) over a 5-game rolling-average baseline by **‚â• 12 %** for each target.
- Achieve target MAE thresholds:
  - **PTS:** ‚â§ 3.6
  - **REB:** ‚â§ 2.5
  - **AST:** ‚â§ 2.2
- For the **top 20 players by minutes played** in the test period, improve MAE by **‚â• 8 %** versus the baseline for each target.

#### Secondary goals (stretch)

These goals will be tackled **if time allows**:

- End-to-end determinism and reproducibility (frozen data, pinned environment, fixed seeds).
- Interpretable insights via global feature importance and local explanations using SHAP.
- An interactive dashboard for exploring predictions, residuals, and feature impacts.

---

### 3) Data Collection (What and How)

#### Freeze window

- **Seasons:** 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25 (regular season only).
- **Data freeze date:** **2025-04-15 23:59:59 UTC**.

#### Primary sources

- **NBA Stats API** via the `nba_api` Python library (preferred):
  - Player game logs (person_id, game_id, date, team_id, opponent_id, minutes, PTS/REB/AST, FGA/3PA/FTA, usage, starter flag).
  - Team context snapshots (offensive_rating, defensive_rating, pace; season-to-date and trailing windows).
  - Schedules (game dates, home/away, opponent).
- **Basketball-Reference** (backup/augmentation; used sparingly and in compliance with robots.txt):
  - Player game logs and team schedule pages.
  - Fills gaps if encountered with the primary API.
- **Injury/availability reports** are optional; we will only pursue them if a reliable source can be integrated easily.

#### Acquisition approach

Implement Python collectors under `src/data/`:

- `collect_player_gamelogs.py`: write to `data/raw/player_gamelogs_{season}.parquet`
- `collect_team_context.py`: write to `data/raw/team_context_{season}.parquet`
- `collect_schedule.py`: write to `data/raw/schedules_{season}.parquet`

**Reference data:**

- `data/reference/arenas.csv`: arena lat/lon for travel distance (Haversine) and home arena mapping.
- `data/reference/team_id_map.csv`: mapping among NBA Stats IDs, Basketball-Reference IDs, and names.

**Controls:**

- Rate limit to **‚â§ 1 req/sec** with retry/backoff.
- Cache all HTTP responses in `data/cache/` for reproducibility.
- Log provenance and hashes; snapshot raw files with immutable filenames that include the freeze date.

---

### 4) Data Cleaning (Strict Rules)

Cleaning rules ensure data quality while preventing leakage.

**Identifier standardisation**

- Normalise player and team IDs to NBA Stats IDs (`person_id`, `team_id`) and include a crosswalk to Basketball-Reference IDs.

**Missing data**

- Exclude **DNP** (Did Not Play) games from training.
- Impute missing context features using time-aware methods (last observation carried forward capped at a **10-day** window); otherwise mark with binary `context_missing` flags and median imputation.

**Integrity checks**

- Deduplicate by `(person_id, game_id)`.
- Remove negative or nonsensical stats; **winsorise** outliers at the **99.9th percentile** per feature.

**Alignment and derived variables**

- Merge player-level rows with the **nearest preceding** team context snapshot (no future leakage).
- Compute **rest days** based on the previous game date per player.
- **Travel distance features (optional):** compute Haversine distance from the previous game's location to the current arena using the arena mapping.
  For the minimal pipeline, a simpler **home/away** flag and **rest days** will suffice.

**Logging**

- Save a cleaning report to `reports/cleaning/cleaning_log_{date}.json` with counts of dropped and imputed records.

---

### 5) Feature Engineering (Leakage-Safe)

All rolling/exponential features use only games **strictly before** the current game date for the same player.

**Recent form**

- Rolling averages: `last_3` and `last_5` for `pts`, `reb`, `ast`, `minutes`, `usage_pct`, `fga`, `fta`, `fg3a`, `tov`.
- Exponentially weighted mean (EWM) with **halflife = 3 games** for the same set.

**Opponent strength and tempo**

- Opponent `defensive_rating`, `offensive_rating`, and `pace` based on **trailing 10 games** and **season-to-date** snapshots.
- **Optional extension:** opponent allowances by position (average PTS/REB/AST allowed per position over trailing 10 games) if reliable positional data can be sourced.

**Context**

- `is_home` flag (binary)
- `rest_days` bucketed as **0, 1, 2, 3+**
- `back_to_back` flag and `three_in_four` flag
- Month of season and a **pre/post All-Star break** flag
- **Optional extension:** travel distance since the previous game; cumulative minutes in the last **7** and **14** days

**Stability and robustness**

- Clip extreme rolling values; add `insufficient_history` flags when fewer than _k_ prior games exist.
- Persist the engineered dataset to `data/processed/features.parquet`; document columns in `docs/features.md`.

---

### 6) Modeling Plan

**Targets**
Three independent regression tasks: **PTS**, **REB**, and **AST**.

**Baselines**

- Last-game value baseline
- 5-game rolling average baseline
- EWM baseline (halflife = 3)

**Models**
To keep the initial scope manageable, we will start with a **regularised linear model** and **one tree-ensemble** model, using a small grid of hyperparameters. If time permits, we can explore additional models.

- Regularised linear: **Ridge**, **Lasso** (with standardised numeric features)
- Tree ensembles: **RandomForestRegressor**, **XGBoostRegressor** (`xgboost` library)
  _LightGBM may be explored as a stretch goal._

**Feature handling**

- One-hot encode categorical flags; scale continuous features for linear models; tree models use raw scales.
- Feature selection via mutual information or model-based importance is optional and will be documented if applied.

**Hyperparameter search**

- Use **time-aware cross-validation** (rolling origin) on the training period.
- Small, explicit grids to control compute:
  - Ridge/Lasso: `alpha ‚àà {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5}`
  - RandomForest: `n_estimators ‚àà {400, 800}`, `max_depth ‚àà {8, 12, None}`, `min_samples_leaf ‚àà {1, 3}`
  - XGBoost: `max_depth ‚àà {4, 6, 8}`, `learning_rate ‚àà {0.03, 0.06}`, `n_estimators ‚àà {400, 800}`, `subsample ‚àà {0.7, 1.0}`, `colsample_bytree ‚àà {0.7, 1.0}`
- For XGBoost, use **early stopping** with a time-forward validation split.

**Artifacts**

- Save the best model per target plus any scaler/encoder to `artifacts/models/{target}_{model}.joblib`.
- Save full metrics and cross-validation results to `artifacts/metrics/{target}_metrics.json`.

**Interpretability (stretch)**

- **Global:** permutation importance and (for XGBoost) built-in feature importance metrics.
- **Local:** SHAP value summaries for a sample of games/players.
  _This is optional and will only be pursued after the minimal pipeline is complete._

### 7) Visualization Plan

**Exploratory plots (static)**
Create static PNGs under `reports/figures/` to explore data and model behaviour:

- Distributions of points, rebounds, and assists
- Scatter plots of minutes vs. points/rebounds/assists
- Residuals vs. key features

**Interactive dashboard (stretch)**
Implement a local interactive dashboard using **Plotly Dash** or **Streamlit** only after the core pipeline is complete. If developed, the app will support:

- Predicted vs. actual values for each target with drill-down by player and date
- Residual distributions and error heatmaps by opponent and rest buckets
- Feature importance charts (global) and local explanations per game

Launch locally with:

```bash
make app
```

### 8) Test Plan (Strict, Time-Based)

#### Data slicing

Use only regular season games, respecting the freeze date **2025-04-15**:

- **Train:** 2022-10-01 to 2024-12-31
- **Validation:** 2025-01-01 to 2025-03-15
- **Test (hold-out):** 2025-03-16 to 2025-04-15

#### Evaluation metrics

- Report **MAE** (primary) and **RMSE** (secondary) for each target on the validation and test sets.
- Compare against baselines; report **absolute values** and **percentage improvement**.
- Compute **per-player metrics** for the top 20 players by minutes played in the test period.

#### Uncertainty quantification

- Bootstrap the test set (**1,000 resamples**) to compute **95% confidence intervals** for MAE deltas versus baseline.

#### Leakage checks

- Unit tests confirm that all rolling features use **only prior games**.
- Verify that no **post-game context** leaks (e.g., final ratings or season averages after the game).

#### Continuous Integration (CI) tests

- On every commit/PR, run **unit tests**, **linting**, and a **small pipeline** on a two-week subsample.

#### Acceptance criteria

- The **minimal pipeline** must meet the success criteria listed above across the test period and per-player slice.
- **Advanced features** are optional and will **not** block acceptance of the project.

### 9) Repository Layout

The repository is structured to support modular development and reproducibility:

- `src/`
  - `data/`: data acquisition scripts and ID mapping
  - `features/`: feature engineering pipeline
  - `models/`: training, hyperparameter search, evaluation
  - `app/`: dashboard code (**optional**)
  - `utils/`: common helpers (IO, logging, time splits)
- `data/`
  - `raw/`, `interim/`, `processed/`, `cache/`, `reference/`
- `artifacts/`
  - `models/`, `metrics/`, `shap/`
- `reports/`
  - `figures/`, `cleaning/`
- `docs/`
  - `data_dictionary.md`, `features.md`, `modeling.md`
- `tests/`
  - `unit/`, `integration/`
- `.github/workflows/`
  - `ci.yml` (continuous integration pipeline)
- `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`), `README.md`

---

### 10) Prioritisation Plan

Given the **two-month** timeline, our strategy is to deliver the **core pipeline early**, ensuring data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, baseline models, and **one main model** are working end-to-end.

We will then iterate and, **if time permits**:

- Expand the feature set (e.g., travel distance, opponent positional allowances).
- Explore additional models.
- Implement interpretability tools.
- Build an interactive dashboard.

Any advanced component can be **dropped or postponed** without jeopardising the ability to meet the **core success criteria**.

## How to Test the Code

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_features.py -v

# Run specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_features.py::test_leakage_prevention -v
```

### Test Structure

- `tests/unit/` - 16 unit tests for individual functions
  - `test_features.py` - 7 tests for leakage-safe feature computation with known values
  - `test_models.py` - 9 tests for model selection, hyperparameters, scaling
- `tests/integration/` - 8 integration tests
  - `test_pipeline.py` - End-to-end pipeline compatibility tests

### GitHub Actions CI

## How to Contribute

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes and test:**

   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/

   # Run linting
   black src/ tests/
   flake8 src/ tests/
   ```

3. **Commit with clear messages:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

4. **Push and create a pull request:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use `black==23.12.1` for automatic formatting (version must match CI)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Add docstrings to all functions (Google style)

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Add tests first** that validate mathematical correctness with known values
2. Implement the feature
3. Ensure no data leakage (features must use only past data via `.shift(1)`)
4. Update documentation
5. Run full test suite before submitting PR

Example test pattern:

```python
def test_new_feature_calculation():
    """Test that new feature calculates correctly with known values."""
    test_data = pd.DataFrame({
        'PLAYER_ID': [1] * 5,
        'STAT': [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
    })
    result = calculate_new_feature(test_data)

    # Verify with known correct answer
    expected = 15.0  # Known value: avg([10, 20])
    assert result.iloc[2]['new_feature'] == expected
```
